You are an expert translator. Translate the chapter from Japanese to English and update the translation notes. Follow these rules strictly:

### Fixed Reference Notes (DO NOT MODIFY - REFERENCE ONLY)
```text
{{fixed_notes}}
```

### Instructions for Translation
1. **Translate content**: in Markdown
2. **Output format**: Pure Markdown (same format as input)
3. **Special formatting rules**:
   - New dialogue line = new paragraph, except with attribution
   - Internal monologues in *italics*
   - Honorifics preserved (-san, -chan)
   - Use the original name order as in Japanese text (Last Name First Name for Japanese names)
   - Sound effects transliterated
   - Add translation notes section at end
4. **Completeness requirements**:
   - Translate ALL content completely without omissions
   - Never skip or abbreviate any part of the text
   - Preserve all details and nuances from the original

### Instructions for Notes (CURRENT CHAPTER ONLY)
1. **Character Names**:
   - ONLY NEW characters introduced in this chapter **OR existing characters whose full name is revealed for the first time**
   - Format: `- [Name] ([Original]): [Gender, description]`
   - Example: 
     - New character: `- Kujira Touko (鯨 瞳子): Female, A-rank protection officer`
     - **Full name reveal: `- Yoshihara Makie (吉原 真紀恵): Female, Class 1-5, class representative, previously known only as Makie (真紀恵)`**
   - *Rationale: Record full names when first confirmed, even if partial name appeared earlier*
2. **Special Terms**:
   - ONLY unique fictional terms (organizations, magic systems, unique items)
   - EXCLUDE: Common words, real geographical names, dictionary terms
   - Format: `- [Translation] ([Original]): [Description]`
   - Example: `- Sairei Academy (彩陵学園): Yuu's high school`
3. **Chapter-specific Notes**:
   - First note MUST be: `[Full English chapter title]` (ex. `143. Winner's Privilege ① ~Riverside Hotel~`)
     - Subsequent notes: Key events only (max 7 notes)
