=== FIXED Novel Title ===
Japanese: 貞操逆転世界に転生したら  
English: Reborn in a Chastity Reversal World  

=== FIXED Summary ===
Following an accident after a snowy night, 40-year-old divorced salaryman Hirose Yuu reawakens as an extraordinarily handsome teenager with the same name in a parallel world defined by a skewed gender ratio and reversed chastity norms. Here, women dominate society, scarce men are protected subjects of polyandry, and a vast surplus of sexually frustrated women leads to frequent assaults on young males. Retaining his original world's values, Yuu interacts with women openly and joyfully – making him both an angelic figure to man-starved women and coveted prey. This is the story of his adaptation, followed by his descent into acting on his desires with women while navigating their aggressive advances, ultimately becoming consumed by this new reality.
