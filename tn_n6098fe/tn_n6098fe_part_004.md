## Prologue ~Upside-Down~

### Author's Preface

I began writing this by referencing previously read chastity reversal novels while adding my own expressions.

The prologue contains a lengthy account of the protagonist's past starting midway through. For readers who wish to skip this and jump straight to the Chastity Reversal World section, I've summarized the content in three lines in the afterword.

―――Friday, March 2015.

A strong, humid cold air mass covering the Japanese archipelago caused temperatures to drop to early-January levels, with snow beginning around noon.

Heavy snowfall struck not only Hokkaido and Tohoku but also wide areas including Kanto, Chubu, and regions from San'in to northern Kyushu. Even in the greater Tokyo plain, 25-50cm of accumulated snow forced train services and other transportation to suspend operations or experience major delays, throwing the weekend rush hour commute into chaos.―――

  

The next morning around 6:30 AM.  
A town in southern Saitama Prefecture.  

Amid streets transformed into a silver world by snow, a middle-aged man climbed a slope. He wore a dark gray suit with a shoulder bag slung diagonally, perhaps to keep both hands free. His unsteady gait since earlier was due to the road surface having frozen solid overnight.

  

"Haah, haah, hee, fuu... Gwah! That was close!"

The man slipped on his stepping right foot, losing his balance. Instinctively leaning forward, he caught himself with one hand on the ground. Though an undignified posture, it beat falling. Besides, few people walked this early on a Saturday morning, so he didn't worry about being seen. No neighbors seemed to be shoveling snow yet either. The occasional grinding sound of ice being scraped came from cars driving with tire chains - the only disturbance in the otherwise silent surroundings.

  

Leather shoes on snow-covered roads made for the worst combination. Yet even with heavy snow forecast, a salaryman couldn't abandon the suit-and-leather-shoes uniform when commuting. While most workers had struggled home amid yesterday's transportation chaos, he'd stayed overnight at the office since he planned to work late anyway. Hence his current struggle to return home this morning.

  

His name was Hirose Yuu.  
40 years old, single, divorced.  
Slightly over 170cm tall.  
Though his weight had stayed within standard range until about ten years ago, it had entered the high 80kg range three years prior. While his suit hid it, excess fat clearly accumulated around his waist. Each company health check came with a "lifestyle warning" envelope attached, marking him as pre-diabetic.

  

"Almost there... just past the bridge... Haah, haah, this is tough..."

Ahead lay an upward slope leading to a bridge - the midpoint between the station and his apartment. What normally took 6-7 minutes from the station had already taken twice as long. The time wasn't the issue though. Balancing and bracing to avoid falling strained his under-exercised legs and back, causing pain and fatigue. All because of the frozen roads. For Tokyo residents who rarely saw snow, this much accumulation happened only once or twice a year. Unaccustomed to it, they suffered greatly when it did come. Slopes without handholds were the worst.

After slipping repeatedly and nearly crawling on all fours, Yuu finally reached the bridge from its approach slope.

  

The bridge deck - barely wide enough for cars to pass with no center line - bore multiple tire tracks packed solid from last night's traffic. The snow pushed to both sides actually provided better traction despite sinking his whole shoe. But some spots remained slippery, requiring constant vigilance.

  

Catching his breath on the bridge, Yuu looked down at the town. Blanketed pure white, it glittered under the dawn light. A magnificent sight rarely seen in the Tokyo area - if one ignored needing to walk through it.

  

"Haaah~"

A sigh escaped unintentionally. His breath whitened in the air. Though he'd shivered in the cold morning air leaving the station, he'd worked up a sweat walking here. Stopping on the bridge exposed him to the biting wind along the river, rapidly chilling his body. Yet Yuu remained motionless for a while. Having slept on chairs in his office (which lacked proper rest facilities), he'd gotten little sleep despite exhaustion from constant overtime. The uncomfortable sleeping position made his joints creak audibly when he stretched.

Walking sleep-deprived on frozen roads was brutal. Yuu brushed snow off the bridge railing and leaned on it. The concrete felt wet and bitterly cold, but he ignored it as he gazed at the view.

  

"Forty years old... that's 'no confusion' age, right?"

He recalled a classical Chinese text passage about reaching enlightenment by forty - the so-called "age of no confusion."

*"No confusion? I'm nothing but confused."*

The mutter slipped out. Though forty, he'd turn forty-one in three months. Time seemed to pass increasingly faster. Would he just keep aging aimlessly like this?

As a child, forty seemed like proper adulthood, but reflecting on himself, he lacked confidence to claim that status. His life felt full of regrets. Approaching forty had definitely increased how often he looked back thinking, "If only I'd done this differently back then..."

During his university graduation around the so-called "employment ice age," he'd applied to dozens of companies starting April of his senior year with no offers. After six months of job hunting, he finally got hired by a mid-sized publisher - an industry he'd never considered. Still, he worked hard to learn the job and contribute.

  

Then in his sixth year, his supervisor suddenly hospitalized, Yuu attended a client meeting as emergency replacement. There he met a young woman. Fresh-faced in her second year, she seemed present as a general assistant, yet something drew him to her instantly.

Not particularly beautiful. Long black hair and slender build stood out. Fair-skinned but with narrow eyes, small nose and mouth - an unremarkably plain, quiet type.

  

Though inexperienced with women, Yuu pushed aggressively this time. He secretly got her contact info after the third meeting. When he repeatedly invited her after work, she never refused, boosting his confidence. Gradually closing the distance, he got official confirmation of their relationship returning from drinks one Friday night. Two months later, at her request, they visited a famous amusement park. On their return, they shared their first kiss. However, lacking experience beyond paid services, Yuu never progressed to sexual intercourse.

Still, after over a year dating - Yuu at 29, her at 25 - they married.

  

That period was likely Yuu's peak. The reason she consistently refused sex? Uncommonly for the times, she wanted to preserve her chastity until marriage. Yuu rejoiced - most men yearn to be a woman's first. However, being a virgin until her mid-twenties made her sexually passive. The painful first night traumatized her, and Yuu's amateur skills couldn't please her mind or body. Consequently, their marital sex life became disappointingly poor.

His wife was still mid-twenties. Respecting her wish to keep working, contraception became routine during their rare encounters. No need to rush. Married senior colleagues said children brought massive expenses. Their current home was a rented apartment, but owning a house or condo would be ideal. To afford that, they needed to save aggressively while both working. Neither had expensive hobbies, so by her thirties they should have decent savings.

Back then, Yuu never doubted a future with his chaste wife and cute child bringing modest happiness.

  

Third year of marriage. His wife started coming home late claiming "work got busy," acting distant. At night, she refused him citing exhaustion. When Yuu pressed before a day off, she emotionally snapped "I don't want to!" adding "You're a man - handle it yourself if you need it so badly!" leaving him speechless. Still loving her, Yuu respected her wishes rather than arguing.

Eventually, seeing her wear unfamiliar clothes and go out alone on days off, he realized her love had faded while suspecting infidelity. Somewhere in his heart wanting to believe, Yuu agonized without confronting her, deciding to wait and see.

What shattered Yuu's hopes was his wife's icy declaration one night:  
"Let's divorce."  

Simultaneously, she presented green papers - a divorce form with her section already filled and stamped.  

She readily admitted the affair. While not naming the man, she giddily explained she'd met him through work after marriage and awakened to true love - an expression he'd never seen before. Though the guilty party should pay compensation, she long refused to admit fault. Finally, her words "I never wanted to marry you in the first place" crushed Yuu. Realizing he couldn't win her back, he still intended to settle properly. Through connections, he involved a lawyer. After a month, they divorced with Yuu receiving below-standard compensation. His wife had already moved out. Whether spent on the affair or gifted to the man, her salary account had dwindled significantly. Exhausted by the turmoil, Yuu didn't push for more.

  

The year after divorcing, prolonged publishing industry decline forced massive layoffs. Yuu kept his job but transferred to an affiliate. The entire industry struggled financially - salaries stagnated while workloads grew everywhere. The new company collapsed in under two years when the president fled overnight. In his mid-thirties, Yuu faced job hunting.

Unable to be picky, he interviewed everywhere but found no takers for his unremarkable qualifications. After three months on unemployment benefits, he got hired in the eternally understaffed "new 3K job" of caregiving - an assistant at a Tokyo nursing home.

  

The pay dropped sharply while work grew physically demanding with long hours. The gap between pre-hire descriptions and reality stemmed from industry labor shortages - he resigned himself to its exploitative nature. Still, he couldn't quit. After nearly five years, he grew accustomed to being yelled at by younger staff and elderly residents. His emotions had numbed - he accepted this job required abandoning normal thinking.

After reemployment, he tried marriage hunting the following year. Though his parents didn't pressure him post-divorce, mid-thirties felt too early to give up. Yuu's father died in an accident during his infancy, leaving a single-mother household. His three-years-older sister broke up with her company boyfriend after five years together when he cheated with a new hire. At 29, having assumed marriage was certain, she abandoned romance for work after the split. Yuu bitterly reflected they were siblings cursed in love.

But with low income plus being from a single-mother home with an elderly single sister, Yuu held little value in the marriage market. Within a year, seeing no future, he gave up.

  

Returning to his messy, dirty apartment, no one greeted him. He just collapsed onto the perpetually unfurled futon.  
*"How did it come to this?"*  

When marrying before thirty, he never imagined this life ten years later. Failed marriage, failed career. Where had he gone wrong? Lacking talent? Not trying hard enough? Bad luck? Everything seemed to have gradually flowed in the wrong direction. Was his life cursed?

Lately, Yuu increasingly wished he could return to the past. Before marriage? No, student days would be better. This time, he'd waste no time - identifying his life plan early and preparing for whatever fate awaited...

*"This isn't a story. That could never happen."*

Shaking his head, Yuu released the railing and started walking. Before contemplating life, he just wanted sleep. To reach it, he had to traverse this frozen road.

  

After crossing the 100m bridge, he looked ahead.  
"Ha... Impossible."  

The descending slope beyond was steeper than the ascent. About 200m ahead lay an intersection without traffic lights, curving right beyond it. Following the road through this residential area of houses mixed with apartments and condos should lead to his building.

Yuu looked left and right. Detouring meant returning to cross another bridge. He immediately dismissed the idea - all roads would be equally frozen, just taking longer.

  

"Maybe I should just slide down...  
...No. I'd get wet and rip my pants."

Though cheap department store suits, his finances couldn't easily replace them. With cardboard, he could slide like childhood riverbank games - assuming no cars at the intersection.

No brilliant ideas came. Sighing, Yuu cautiously began descending while bracing against a utility pole with his right hand.

Sluurp.  
"Gah!"  

He slipped within steps. Choosing spots with visible pavement over solid snowpack proved equally slippery with thin ice. Leaning on a concrete wall with his right hand, he inched down at tortoise speed. Frozen surfaces slid easily even on level ground - slopes were worse. Slipping again, he fell hard on his backside.

"Ow! Damn it!"  

Sitting there, he glared at the frozen road. No passersby on a Saturday morning spared him embarrassment - small mercy. He hadn't covered one-third of the distance to the intersection. Beyond it, the right side became a parking lot with nothing to hold.

  

"Damn it. Whatever."  

Yuu stood up. Resigned, he decided to just run down - if he'd fall anyway. He stepped normally but immediately slipped and fell, starting to slide uncontrollably.

"Wha-? Hey... WHOOOOAAAAAH!"  

Gaining speed as he tumbled, he tried bracing with both hands but failed.  
"Guh!"  

Falling backward snagged his shoulder bag strap under his chin. Fortunately, it detached immediately. Bag abandoned, the lighter Yuu slid faster.

Hardened overnight by traffic into bumpy ruts, the slope made his body tumble violently, striking the ground repeatedly with pain. But the short distance soon brought him to the intersection. Though the gradient eased there, his momentum carried him forward.

"Tch, gotta stop around there...  
No cars, right?"

Bad premonitions in such moments tend to come true.

  

Sssssssssssssss...  

More sliding than driving, a bright red sports car entered the intersection from the right at the same moment.  
"No way?!"  

Yuu wasn't alone in shock - the driver seemed equally startled. Strangely, the moment flowed in slow motion for Yuu. The horrified female driver jerked the wheel. Tires locked. The worst possible snow-driving move - sudden steering and braking. The sports car slid diagonally without stopping, hitting Yuu mid-intersection.

THUD!  

Though the car wasn't speeding, Yuu - sliding uncontrollably - got flung sideways by the impact.  
"Ah... this is bad."  

At that moment, Yuu remained conscious, not thinking he'd die. Just *"Unlucky."*  

But his landing spot proved disastrous. Airborne and unable to brace, Yuu slammed hard into a corner apartment complex wall. Excruciating pain shot through his entire body starting from his head. As his vision went black, Yuu's consciousness faded.
