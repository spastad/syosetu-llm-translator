## 2. Spring Break ① ~1990~

"Ugh... Where... is this?"

When he opened his eyes, he saw an unfamiliar ceiling. 

An opulent chandelier hung from a chic-toned ceiling with dark brown as the base, accented by orange and cream lines. When Yuu tried to turn his head to look around, a sharp pain shot through his skull.

Touching his head, he felt something like bandages wrapped around it with a net covering them.

  

"Oww... Wh-what happened to me...?"

Yuu, who had been lying on his back, tried to lift his head. He understood he was lying on a bed. That much was fine. But why was it so unusually wide, almost like a double bed?

He tried to look around the room. It was extravagantly spacious for one person - easily over 20 tatami mats in size. The floor seemed to be covered in a warm-toned, long-pile carpet. Walking barefoot on it would probably feel wonderful. High-end furniture in coordinated dark brown with gold trim was placed throughout the room. To the right of the bed was a table set with three chairs. At the foot of the bed sat a black leather sofa and coffee table.

Thick, luxurious curtains covered the window to his left, but faint sunlight seeped through, confirming it was daytime. Near the window, an expensive-looking vase filled with colorful roses sat atop a chest. Though he'd never stayed in one, the room reminded Yuu of a hotel suite.

  

Suddenly, several images flashed through Yuu's mind. 

An icy steep downhill slope. 

Himself slipping and tumbling down. 

The horrified expression of a woman driving a bright red sports car at the intersection. 

And the sharp vehicle rapidly approaching.

  

"That's right... I got hit by a car..."

Yuu finally remembered what had happened to him. It was fortunate he hadn't died and had regained consciousness. He assumed the woman driver or a neighbor must have called an ambulance. But that didn't explain why this wasn't a hospital room.

  

The half-sitting position was uncomfortable, so he lay flat again. His whole body felt strange - almost as if it wasn't his own. The bed was plush and comfortable.

  

He tried to reason through his situation. "Was that woman driving the red sports car super rich... or maybe a rich family's daughter?" She hadn't seemed young at first glance, but it made more sense that wealthy parents had arranged this after their daughter begged them following the accident. Maybe her family was in a position where the accident couldn't become public. That suggested this might be a VIP hospital room rather than a hotel. He recalled seeing special treatment rooms for politicians and celebrities in medical dramas.

  

As Yuu was lost in thought, the door at the far right opened, and a nurse in white uniform appeared. She wore a nurse's cap over her short black hair. Her perfectly symmetrical features gave a somewhat cold impression, but her dignified face was undeniably beautiful - the very image of a competent nurse. She appeared to be in her mid-twenties. Tall and slender, she carried herself professionally. 

The moment she entered and saw Yuu awake in bed, she smiled brightly and said:

  

"You've regained consciousness! How wonderful... How are you feeling, Hirose-sama?"

Her smiling face was captivating, and her clear voice carried well despite not being loud. She looked like a beautiful nurse straight out of a drama. Fitting for a VIP room.

  

"Ah, um... My head still hurts...?"

Yuu felt uneasy about how high-pitched his voice sounded. *Did I always sound like this?* Was it because he just woke up? Or was he nervous around this beautiful nurse?

  

"I'll fetch the doctor immediately. My apologies, but please wait a moment."

After a deep bow, she exited through the same door. The overly polite treatment made Yuu feel awkward. Would the woman who drove the car come too? He needed to question her about the situation. Even though she appeared suddenly, she was the driver - she was at fault. Surely they wouldn't ask him to pay the hospital bills...

As Yuu stared blankly at the ceiling, the door suddenly banged open, and a breathless woman's voice reached his ears.

  

"Yuu! Yuu-chan!"

  

She was unmistakably a Latin beauty with tanned skin. Probably just turned 30. Her long hair had gentle waves in a natural chestnut brown - what would be called brunette. Her features were deeply sculpted and well-defined, with almond-shaped eyes and angry-looking eyebrows that gave her a strong gaze. The moment she saw Yuu awake in bed, her eyes widened, clearly revealing their light brown color.

She dashed daddatto toward the bed where Yuu lay on his back.

  

*(Who is this?)*

For Yuu, the only women who'd rush to his hospital bedside would be his mother or sister. Since joining his current company, he'd stopped going to bars or clubs. He had absolutely no personal or professional relationships with young foreign women. He'd never even seen such a beauty who looked like she'd stepped out of a Hollywood movie or Miss Universe pageant.

She was slightly taller than Yuu, but her most striking feature was her magnificent breasts that looked like they contained melons. *(Whoa...)* She wore a black pantsuit with a thin red inner layer, and as she ran closer, her breasts bounced burun burun so dramatically that Yuu's eyes were involuntarily drawn to them.

  

"Thank goodness... Mama was so worried... so worried that Yuu-chan might never wake up..."

Tears immediately welled in her eyes. *(Mama? Like a bar mama-san?)* The moment this thought crossed his mind, she hugged him gabatto with powerful force. 

Despite her flashy appearance, her citrus perfume was surprisingly subtle and tickled Yuu's nostrils. Before he could process it, her arms wrapped around his upper back and neck (avoiding his injuries). "Oof!" Yuu's face was pressed into the center of her ample bosom, squeezed gyuutt between two melons.

*(Soft but incredible pressure... Wait, I can't breathe...)*

  

Being smothered by a beautiful woman's large breasts - something any man should welcome. But Yuu was mentally unprepared, and the unexpected breathlessness made him panic.

  

"E-excuse me, Madam! Your son seems to be struggling...!"

The nurse who had followed immediately spoke up timidly from behind.

*(Goshisoku... goshisoku? Oh, that means "son.")* While suffocating and nearly passing out, Yuu processed the word's meaning. Why were they calling him her son? He vaguely wondered.

  

"Ah! S-sorry! 

Aaaaaah! You hated that, didn't you, Yuu-chan?!  
Ugh, ugh... *hic*. But Mama was so worried about Yuu-chan, she just..."

Even after pulling away, she began sobbing right before his eyes. Yuu could only stare blankly.

*(If you cry that much, your makeup will run)* he thought absently, his mind struggling to keep up with these surreal events.

  

"Foh foh foh. Well now, it's only natural to worry about one's precious son."

Walking slowly behind the nurse was a small-statured elderly man in a white coat, his white hair slicked back. 

"Se-sensei..."

"Let me examine you now that you've finally regained consciousness."

He took out a stethoscope, clearly a doctor. The nurse prepared to take notes.

  

As the Latin beauty stepped aside, the old doctor approached the bedside. The nurse pressed something near the foot of the bed, causing the upper section to rise. With Yuu now in a more comfortable position, the doctor unbuttoned his pajamas, revealing a white T-shirt. Neither woman seemed to notice they were sending heated glances at his exposed skin.

Yuu was too preoccupied with his own body. *(Why am I so thin?!)* His formerly protruding belly was flat. His bandaged right elbow, waistline - everything was slender. Like he'd returned to his teens. No, even slimmer than back then.

  

"Can you tell me your name?"

Yuu, who'd been looking down at his body, hurriedly looked up. "Ah... Hirose Yuu."

"Date of birth?"

"June 30, 1975."

"Can you state your family structure?"

"Um, my father died young. I have my mother and sister."

  

Probably questions to check for memory impairment from the head injury. Though nervous, he answered smoothly and felt relieved.

"Hmm. You seem aware of yourself. That's reassuring for now." The old doctor turned around. "Yuu-chan... Thank goodness. You remember Mama, right?"

"Huh?"

"Huh?"

They stared at each other involuntarily. The doctor interjected. "What's this? Have you forgotten your mother's face?"

"Mo... mother? This person?  
No no no no... My mother isn't this young and beautiful!"

An anime movie reference from Yuu's middle school days surfaced. This wasn't some Red Comet - how could a younger woman be his mother?

"Yuu-chan, how could you...?"

The woman showed sadness and confusion at Yuu's words. But noticing he'd called her "young and beautiful," her mouth relaxed momentarily before showing a complex expression.

  

"Hmm. You've been in a coma for three days since being brought here. Do you remember what happened to you?"

Yuu tried to answer the doctor's question. He'd recalled it when he first woke up - an easy question. But now his memories seemed muddled, and completely unfamiliar scenes were gradually surfacing in his mind.

"Pretty sure... I slipped down a slope... Was someone chasing me? No, impossible.  
A pedestrian bridge? No, at the intersection entrance... um... a woman... That's right! A car hit me... Hmm? Someone clinging from behind?"

A shiver ran through Yuu's body, accompanied by overwhelming terror. "A, a, aaaaaaah... No! Nooo! So many... attacking! Someone help! Stop! Stoooooooooooooop!!!"

"Yuu-chan!"

"Sedative."

Stopping the woman who tried to approach Yuu as he clutched his head, the doctor calmly instructed the nurse.

  

  

  

  

Observing Yuu who had calmed after the sedative, the doctor and woman spoke.

"Seems the head injury has caused memory confusion."

"Doctor! Will Yuu-chan be alright?!"

"Calm yourself. The injuries will take time to heal regardless. Let him rest quietly. As his mind settles, his memories should return. That's all I can say."  
"Y-yes.  
...Kuh! I'll never forgive those women who did this to Yuu-chan!"

Yuu couldn't understand why she was so angry. Dazed, he pondered while looking at his raised hands. *(Something's... wrong)*

  

"Excuse me. Could I see a mirror?"

"A... mirror?!"

"Yes."

For some reason, the woman panicked. "Y-your face is fine! Not a single scar!"

"No, not for that reason."

  

Apparently deeming it harmless, the doctor nodded. The nurse took a hand mirror from the chest drawer and handed it to Yuu. Seeing his face in the mirror became the day's biggest shock.

"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?!"

  

"Yu-Yuu-chan?!"

"More trauma?"

As the woman panicked again, Yuu stopped her with a hand gesture. "No, that's... not it. This face..."

"Seems perfectly fine to me?"

"Like I said! You hit your head hard but miraculously had no facial injuries! Just a sprained ankle and scraped elbows/knees that'll heal quickly!"

"R-right... Hmm..."

  

Reflected in the mirror wasn't Yuu's familiar 40-year-old salaryman face, but a strikingly handsome teenage boy around mid-teens. A so-called "sauce face" - his deeply sculpted features suggested mixed Western heritage rather than pure Japanese. After staring at the woman, then checking the mirror again, he could see he'd inherited her eyes and nose. It wouldn't be strange if they were mother and son. He'd guessed she was 30-31, but perhaps she was older. His skin tone was closer to an average Japanese person's than her tanned complexion.

Without knowing his father's appearance, he'd clearly inherited the best traits from both parents - an undeniably handsome face presentable anywhere. Yuu recalled a movie: an ancient Roman bath technician time-travels to modern Japan by entering water. The young man in the mirror resembled a younger version of the actor who played the Roman.

*(Seriously? What happened to me...? How did this happen...)* He rubbed his eyes and pinched his cheek, but the handsome boy in the mirror mimicked him and grimaced in pain.

  

Had he simply rejuvenated, he might have accepted it as absurd yet plausible. But this was an unfamiliar handsome face. Yuu's confusion deepened.

"...!"

Perhaps triggered by the mirror. Unfamiliar images flooded his mind. His mental processing couldn't keep up, throwing him into panic. As Yuu clutched his head, the doctor patted his shoulder pon.

"Ah... I, I am..."

"You've only just regained consciousness. No need to rush. Rest now. We'll talk when you've calmed down."  
"Y-yes."  
"In that case, I know you have many questions, but please let him rest for now."

"B-but..."

  

The woman hesitated at the doctor's words but finally nodded. All three prepared to leave. "If anything happens, press the nurse call button by your pillow. We'll come immediately," said the nurse with a gentle smile. Though she was about 10 years older than this body's owner, to Yuu's consciousness she seemed much younger - like an angel's smile.

  

"Ah, your shoelace..."

She must have been too flustered to notice earlier. The woman claiming to be his mother crouched to tie his undone shoelace. Despite her suit, she wore black sneakers with red accents. When Yuu glanced down, her generously exposed cleavage formed a dramatic valley. His cheeks instantly flushed crimson, and he hurriedly looked away.

  

Then he noticed a calendar he'd missed while she was standing. The top half showed a seaside town with white walls and orange roofs against emerald blue water - probably a Mediterranean European port town.

*(Huh?)*

Yuu felt uneasy about the calendar's dates. The vernal equinox day was on a different weekday. And the month's last day wasn't Saturday but a weekday... 

He'd recently worried about needing glasses at his age since his driver's license vision requirement dropped from 0.7 to 0.5. Normally he couldn't see this clearly from this distance. Now he could see sharply - his vision was likely 1.0 or better. Above the dates and weekdays for March on the left side, it read:

### Author's Afterword

In reality, the title "nurse" was unified for both genders in 2001. In this world with reversed chastity norms where men are scarce and the profession is 100% female, "nurse" (看護婦) might seem more appropriate historically. However, since the protagonist comes from the 21st century where "nurse" (看護師) is standard, using both terms could cause confusion. Thus, we'll consistently use "nurse" (看護師).
