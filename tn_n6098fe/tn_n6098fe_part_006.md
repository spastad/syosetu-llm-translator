## 3. Past ① ~Despite Being Spring~

### Author's Preface

An incident that occurred before Hirose Yuu's personality changed in the chastity reversal world.

---

The incident happened on the way home from middle school graduation.

In this world's public middle schools, while nominally coeducational, boys were essentially kept in isolated environments. This was a necessary measure to protect the extremely scarce male population from the overwhelming majority of females driven by adolescent impulses and desires.

Even during the graduation ceremony, boys and girls lined up in the gymnasium were completely separated by volleyball-like nets hanging from the ceiling - with tightly woven mesh making visibility difficult. Though girls could only see below the knees, they kept stealing glances at the boys throughout the ceremony. Girls who happened to line up near the net tried to get close enough to smell the boys or pretended to drop things to peek underneath, constantly being warned by teachers stationed nearby.

At the ceremony's climax, names were called one by one to receive diplomas on stage. For girls, this was a precious - and final - opportunity to openly admire boys. When over 200 third-year girls finally finished, the third-year boys were called. Instantly, the gymnasium filled with murmurs unsuitable for a solemn ceremony. No matter how much teachers shouted "Quiet!", it was useless. Among teachers who'd had no connection with boys - 90% of whom were women - some ignored the students entirely, scrutinizing each boy with hungry eyes.

Among the mere seven boys, when the fifth one - Hirose Yuu - stood on stage, the volume of shrill cheers peaked.

"Yuu-kun!"

"Yuu-chaaan!"

"Hirose senpaaai!"

"Look this way!"

"Eeeek, so handsome!"

He was treated like an idol. Understandably so. Among the few boys, he possessed particularly refined features, a slender build, and a perpetually cool expression. His occasional bright smiles during conversations with male friends weren't for nothing. Throughout all three grades, he was considered the number one boy girls wanted to sleep with. Girls who fell for good-looking boys formed unofficial fan clubs, and Yuu's club was the largest with over 100 members across all grades - though some overlapped with other boys' clubs.

After receiving his diploma, Yuu bowed to the portly principal. He turned around and glanced at the female students from the stage. Though his expression remained blank, the girls' squeals grew even louder.

"He looked at me just now!"

"Gorgeous! Let me have you!"

"Ahhn! Being stared at like that makes me wet!"

Some flushed crimson with excitement, others screamed his name. Perhaps driven by fear, Yuu's cheek twitched before he quickly retreated down the stairs at a brisk pace.

After the ceremony, students would separate into gender-specific buildings, so the only chance for girls to interact with boys was during transit. Graduates exited first after the ceremony through separate entrances. The moment girls left the gym, everyone raced toward the boys' exit. Their desperate, scrambling rush was like a tidal wave, overwhelming teachers trying to restrain them.

This was due to a strange tradition among female students surrounding graduation ceremonies: Removing a button closest to the heart from their uniform, plucking a strand of hair, soaking it in their own blood to dye it red, then tightly tying it to the button. If they could give this to a boy they liked and have him accept it, legend said the red hair would draw them together in the future. Though completely baseless superstition, for girls embroiled in fierce competition over scarce boys, they'd cling to any straw. Of course, for boys forcibly handed these blood-stained hair-tied buttons or having them stuffed into uniform pockets, they only wanted to throw them into the blue sky.

Had Yuu - who came from another world - witnessed this, he might have recalled department store sale days when housewives swarm at opening, or idol-chasing fans. No, these schoolgirls were even more desperate. Many were destined for schools without boys. They ran as if thinking missing this chance meant lifelong regret.

As the third-year girls rounded half the gym, the boys - having sensed danger - hurried toward the male building surrounded by teachers and school-hired security. This annual event meant the school was fully prepared.

Once the boys safely entered the building, the reinforced glass entrance was locked, with burly security guards lined up before it.

"Tch! This is it..."

"Unbelievable!"

"Ah... I at least wanted to see his face up close..."

Girls who'd missed their biggest and last chance to interact with boys collapsed on the spot. After all, boys would leave school surrounded by security, going home one by one in waiting cars. Trying to approach or give something was considered impossible.

Among Yuu's graduating class was a delinquent group notorious even outside school. At its core were three girls we'll call A, B, and C.

A had a sumo wrestler's build, unbeatable in fights, a boss known citywide. B held a black belt in karate with a promising future, but her cruel nature loved tormenting others. After hospitalizing several dojo mates and delinquents from other schools, she was expelled a year ago and started hanging with A. C excelled at currying favor with the strong and scheming rather than physical confrontations.

Their past misdeeds doomed them - they couldn't even get into local bottom-tier high schools. Their only path was becoming petty thugs under yakuza seniors. So before graduation, they planned not revenge attacks on teachers... but kidnapping and raping a boy to get pregnant.

Of course, rape was a serious crime punishable even at 15. But in this world, raping a man, extracting sperm, and getting pregnant could improve their status as rare natural pregnancies. Artificial insemination rarely produced boys, but natural pregnancy offered that possibility. Having a boy - that was their one-shot reversal from the bottom. They'd heard that bearing a boy brought substantial congratulatory money and generous allowances, meaning they wouldn't need to work. Thus, their natural choice was the school's most handsome boy - Yuu.

The delinquents had recruited fan club members as accomplices. The thirty-strong group led by the trio ignored the post-ceremony chaos and pedaled away from the school's back entrance according to plan.

"Hey, stop here."

Four or five minutes after leaving the back gate, Yuu suddenly spoke from the back seat as usual.

"Huh? But..."

"Since it's the last day anyway, I want to walk a bit."

They were on a straight road with good visibility along an embankment. Yuu remembered passing through blooming cherry blossoms in his mother's car when entering middle school. Today was graduation day. Maybe he'd grown somewhat sentimental.

The driver and accompanying women exchanged glances. They were male protection officers dispatched from a security company specializing in male protection. Elite personnel strictly selected and trained physically and mentally to never succumb to arousal and attack despite sharing space with males, while protecting them from multiple female assailants. Their top priority was the male's safety, but fulfilling reasonable requests was also part of their duty.

The passenger seat and back seat officers scanned all directions. Being before noon on a weekday, traffic was sparse. Having left school first, no fellow students were visible yet.

The leader in the back seat turned to Yuu.

"Understood. A short distance should be fine. The car will wait at the bypass road before the bridge."

"Okay. Thanks."

"Mmmph!"

Yuu stretched deeply after getting out. In this world, men couldn't walk outside freely alone. Even with protection officers, breathing outside air felt good to Yuu too. Celebrating graduation, the day was blessed with clear skies, gentle winds, and warm, soft sunlight. Though nights were still cold, the weather hinted that spring was near.

With officers positioned before and behind at a slight distance, Yuu began walking. The embankment road with cherry trees on the right curved sharply left about 500m ahead, merging with the bypass road. Across the bridge was Yuu's apartment.

After walking several minutes, an old woman pushing a stroller across the street stared wide-eyed at Yuu but, noticing the officers flanking him, reluctantly left. Two more cars passed - likely carrying other male graduates. The officers sighed in relief seeing them drive past without stopping. If they could just reach the waiting car uneventfully...

Just as Yuu passed a T-junction without traffic lights, a shrill cry erupted from the left road.

"Yu-Yuu-kun!"

"Got him! Caught up!"

""""Yuu-kun!""""

""""Waiiit!!!""""

About ten female middle schoolers came charging on bicycles. Their blazers bore white "Congrats Graduation" ribbons, and school bags and diploma tubes in front baskets confirmed they were fellow graduates.

"Gah!"

"Bad news!"

"Run!"

Along with Yuu showing horror and terror, the three desperately sprinted.

But for the girls finally seeing their beloved at the last possible moment, this was their climax. Pedaling furiously, they'd catch up quickly.

"Tch! I'll hold them off!"

"Count on me!"

One officer running behind Yuu drew a baton from her hip holster and turned back.

"You shall not pass!"

She stood ready with the baton extended about 1 meter. Charging full speed at her came the bike gang, ignoring the blocking officer. The sharply swung baton struck the two leaders, throwing them off balance.

"Gyaah!"

"Shit!"

Followers couldn't avoid the pileup, crashing loudly. Some thought they'd dodged, but the officer expertly toppled pursuing bikes with baton strikes and long-legged kicks. After all, she was a hand-to-hand combat expert - mere middle schoolers stood no chance. Half the front line was instantly disabled.

"You fucking bitch!"

"Die!"

Two sturdy girls from the rear charged the officer bike-first. Their fury targeted this uncouth officer blocking their Yuu rendezvous. Jealousy also fueled them - while they could only watch boys from afar drooling, these officers got to stay close.

Even bike-charged, the trained officer kicked one bike's front wheel while delivering a perfect thrust to the rider's throat, sending her flying. The other twisted aside at the last moment, grabbing the front basket to fling her away. But the last two slipped past without joining the fight.

"Damn!"

But she reconsidered immediately. Just two middle schoolers - the leader beside Yuu would easily repel them. She'd better disable the surrounding students to prevent follow-ups. Adrenaline from the fight made her forget these ten chasers were just the vanguard.

"Hah, hahh!"

"Almost there! Turn there to the intersection!"

While running and glancing back at Yuu, the leader officer operated her transceiver. No time for leisurely talk, but the driver should know it was an emergency.

Just as they rounded the curve and approached the intersection:

"Got himmmmm! Yuu-kuuun!"

"Waiiit for meeee! I'm coming!"

Over ten more female cyclists charged from the left, identical to before. Simultaneously, they spotted their waiting car across the two-lane bypass.

"Lord Yuu! I'll hold them here! Cross the pedestrian bridge to the car!"

"O-okay. Got it."

Urged by the desperately grimacing officer, Yuu sprinted toward the pedestrian bridge about 50m right.

As the officer prepared to fight this new bike gang like before, someone in the trees grinned. C's delinquent group of seven or eight. They'd used fan club members in two waves to tie up officers, driving Yuu toward the bridge. Across the bypass, A and B waited to grab him onto A's scooter (unlicensed, of course) and kidnap him to a nearby apartment prepared as a rape room.

"Go!"

""""Yeah!""""

As Yuu started climbing the bridge stairs, he saw the delinquents chasing from behind and despaired.

"Wha-what's this!? Why me?"

Though his running speed was decent, non-athletic Yuu was nearing exhaustion. "Hah, hah, dammit. Girls are scary... Can't get caught here..." His legs threatened to tangle, chin lifting as he ran across the bridge. The delinquents maintained a slight distance but couldn't stay calm seeing Yuu's back and butt so close. Like ripe fruit about to fall - who could resist?

"Yuu-kun!"

"I'm cumming now!"

"Hey, wait!"

Three former sports club members with superior stamina broke past C's restraint and accelerated.

Meanwhile, the officer driver who'd seen Yuu being chased had radioed police and her company before rushing from the parked car to protect him.

"Take this!"

"Gah!"

Just before reaching the bridge stairs, the officer took a fierce tackle from sumo-built A and fell. Then came B's powerful kick. Even a trained officer couldn't withstand being caught off guard and attacked by two expert fighters. After tying up the officer and tossing her roadside, A and B smirked defiantly.

"Heh heh. No more pests."

"Once we snatch him, he's ours."

"Yuu-kun, finally caught youuuu!"

Just before the stairs, one girl finally grabbed Yuu's right shoulder from behind.

"Gah!"

Yuu tried to shake her off, but she tightened her grip, refusing to let go. Rather, Yuu's sweaty scent at close range excited her more. As they struggled and slowed, two others tackled from left and right, firmly grabbing his waist. Worse, one reached out and grabbed his crotch.

"Gyah!"

"Oof!"

The girl grabbing his crotch got a nosebleed from the soft sensation and fainted. Still gripped by two others, Yuu stumbled forward with uncooperative legs. The tangled trio hit the bridge railing before toppling sideways. Still clinging together, they tumbled down the stairs.

"Hey!"

This unexpected development stunned A and B waiting at the stairs. The two girls clinging from behind refused to let go in their frenzy. Like dumplings in a ball, the three rolled down, hitting the dazed A and B at full force without stopping at the landing. The impact knocked out the two clinging girls, but their hands remained locked.

"Shit! You screwed up...!"

A, first to rise due to her build, checked Yuu and froze. Knocked unconscious during the fall and hitting his head on the road while supine, blood flowed from Yuu's occiput.

"Wh-what do we do...?"

They'd been fully intent on raping him and taking his chastity, but with his life at stake, they were helpless before the severely injured Yuu. Then sirens wailed from beyond the bypass as multiple police cars arrived.

### Author's Afterword

An incident where an ultra-handsome guy in a chastity-reversed world with extremely few men would naturally get targeted aggressively.

Before it could become a "You're gonna be daddy!" situation, it ended in serious injury as an attempted crime.
