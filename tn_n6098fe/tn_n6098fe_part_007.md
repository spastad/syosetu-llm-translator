## 4. Spring Break ② ~Don't Show Your Tears~

### Author's Preface

Even without any service scenes yet, we've reached #6 on the daily rankings!

I'm deeply grateful for the unexpected bookmarks and evaluations!

"I see... so that's how it is..."

A full day had passed since waking up.

It was the fifth morning since this world's Yuu was attacked by female classmates after graduation and hospitalized with a head injury.

Though initially confused, after conversations with doctors and his mother, he'd mostly sorted out his memories now that he understood who he was.

---

After checking not just the room's calendar but also requesting newspapers to confirm the date, he found an unfamiliar era name but realized it was exactly 25 years before his accident in the Western calendar. Aside from matching his own name, birthdate, and family structure, he was a completely different person. He hypothesized this might be the parallel worlds he'd seen in fiction. In other words, the original him who was hit by a car had likely died, while he'd crossed spacetime to possess this world's Yuu during his coma.

Still, the Latin beauty clumsily peeling an apple before him bore no resemblance to the mother in his memories. Her name was Hirose Martina. Half-Spanish and half-Japanese, her appearance likely favored her Spanish mother. With an older sister three years his senior, she must be at least mid-30s. Foreign adults often look older than Japanese people, but Martina appeared youthful as if barely 30. *Is this the half-blood effect?* Compared to his own mother who looked like an ordinary middle-aged woman by junior high, he couldn't help feeling envious.

"Ufufu~"

Martina had been in high spirits since Yuu called her "Mom." Apparently, this world's Yuu had entered a rebellious phase, maintaining a cold attitude and avoiding face-to-face conversation.

"Want some apple?"

When he nodded, her awkward handling of the fruit knife seemed dangerously clumsy. As a long-time bachelor, the current Yuu might peel better. But watching her earnest efforts, he couldn't bring himself to offer help, watching nervously instead.

Scouring his memories, he found no images of her doing housework like cooking. After losing his father early, she'd worked outside since Yuu's elementary days, leaving housework to housekeepers. These changed yearly, the most recent being a cold-feeling woman around 30.

"Done!"

"Ah..."

Martina proudly puffed her chest holding the peeled apple. Yuu's eyes involuntarily darted to her melon-sized breasts before he hastily looked away. Peel fragments littered the floor, substantial flesh still clinging to them in an uneven, ugly shape. Yet he couldn't feel annoyed knowing she'd struggled to peel it for him.

She placed apple slices cut on a small cutting board into a bowl from the shelf.

"Should I... feed you?"

With his bed reclined upright, he could manage himself. But his body wasn't fully recovered, so he decided to accept Martina's kindness.

"Uh, sure."

"Ahah! Then, aah~"

"Aah~"

He bit into the apple piece held to his lips. The crisp *shari shari* crunch felt satisfying. Yuu preferred crunchy over soft apples, so this suited him.

"Delicious?"

"Yeah, delicious."

"Wah! Yuu-chan! Said my peeled apple was delicious!"

Martina's face lit up like a girl's as she openly expressed joy. To 40-year-old Yuu, even his mother seemed younger. He found her genuine happiness "cute."

"Want more?"

"Yeah"

He ate the pieces she handed him. After finishing half, he said:

"Mom, you should eat too. It's good."

"Ah... okay."

Hearing this, Martina looked suddenly emotional, tearfully staring at Yuu.

"I'm so happy... not just that Yuu-chan regained memories faster than expected, but that you're talking to me like before..."

Martina took out a handkerchief to wipe her eyes.

"Th-that's exaggerated."

He recalled this world's Yuu barely spoke to her. At that age, he too had found his mother annoying. But understanding parental worry for an injured son, he couldn't be harsh now. Besides, sadness didn't suit Latin beauty Martina - he wanted to see her radiant smile.

---

Yuu's memories felt like a dual structure. His primary consciousness was the 40-year-old who should've died, but when focusing on this world's connections—family, school—related memories surfaced from deep within. This caused conversational delays, but doctors attributed it to post-concussion confusion. So far, he'd only met hospital staff and his mother. School officials and security company representatives had come to apologize for the male protection officers, but Martina handled everything, refusing visitors during Yuu's recovery.

"By the way... where's sis?"

"Huh...?"

He'd asked about his sister to lighten the mood, but instantly regretted it.

"E-Elena is... you know, she doesn't come out..."

"Ah, right."

As Yuu remembered his sister, intense disgust flooded him. They barely spoke despite living together, and accidental hallway encounters even drew scorn from her. *What happened between us?* He couldn't immediately recall. Regardless, Elena had secluded herself for over three months and couldn't visit.

"Right! The doctor said recovery might take a month, but you might make the high school entrance ceremony!"

Martina's bright tone shifted Yuu's focus. Though requiring seven head stitches, a skilled female surgeon had minimized scarring. The elderly male doctor he'd met was one of only two part-time male doctors there. *(Come to think of it, men in this world...)* Yuu knew from memories this was a vastly different society, but details needed verification.

"That's good. High school... looking forward to it."

*(Starting high school again at this age... unbelievable.)*

He sighed internally.

"I'm worried about Yuu-chan going to co-ed school. You should've chosen all-boys school. What if girls attack you again?"

Martina's expression darkened remembering the graduation incident. Yuu desperately disagreed internally. *Why suffer all-male schools?* For once, he thanked the original Yuu's choice. Without the attack, he might've refused co-ed schools.

"I-it's fine. Really. Speaking of... what about the attacking girls? And the male protection officers who saved me?"

Martina's expression turned terrifying.

"Fu, fu, fu. I'll make those bitch girls pay properly. Criminal punishment isn't enough - I'll squeeze compensation through civil suits. The security company came immediately to apologize, so we settled. But I'm furious the school bears almost no responsibility!"

This world had juvenile laws similar to Japan's. Girls aged 14-17 committing crimes were sent to rehabilitation facilities with reduced sentences versus adults. But male-targeted crimes were exceptions: attempted rape carried 3-5 years without probation; completed rape 10-20 years imprisonment - facts Yuu recalled from news programs.

The bicycle-chasing "fan club" might've just wanted farewell words, but the delinquents planning abduction deserved no sympathy. Seeing Martina mutter darkly with vengeful eyes, Yuu stayed silent. He wanted to thank the officers who protected him, but provoking her seemed unwise.

This world's extreme male scarcity had reversed chastity norms. Men were protected yet restricted; women became hyper-aggressive in competing for them - as Yuu's attack proved. Despite male protection officers and car transport, Martina's fears were justified. *I thought I died, but was reborn in this insane world.* He resolved to survive.

"Mom."

Yuu reached out, covering Martina's clenched fist.

"Hah! S-sorry! This must upset Yuu-chan. Focus on resting and recovering first."

"Yeah. But... your work?"

"Compared to Yuu-chan's safety, work is... My boss might complain, but I'll stay till discharge."

"I'm fine. Nurses said you've stayed dawn to dusk since admission - thank you. But don't overdo it."

"Y-Yuu-chan worries about me?!"

Martina teared up again, trembling with emotion. At 40, Yuu naturally felt gratitude toward his mother, but this world's Yuu must've been exceptionally cold. Checking her watch near noon, Martina prepared to leave, wrapping leftover apples for the room fridge.

As Yuu tried rising to see her off, she stopped him, so he stayed reclined.

"See you tomorrow."

"Okay."

But Martina lingered, fidgeting.

"Hm? What's wrong?"

"Um... if Yuu-chan doesn't mind... Ah, sorry! Never mind!"

"No, go ahead."

Her hesitation made him curious.

"Um... um... Can I hug you like before?"

"Huh?"

---

He knew hugging wasn't Japanese custom but common abroad. Half-Spanish Martina, born in Japan to immigrant parents, likely followed Latin habits. For Japanese-raised Yuu, family hugs were embarrassing. But her loving concern felt comforting - perhaps normal in this male-scarce world. And as a middle-aged man, being embraced by an attractive woman wasn't unpleasant.

"I-it's fine."

"You hate it, right? At your age... Eh, really?!"

"Really. It'd be embarrassing publicly, but nobody's here."

"Ah! Feels like my old Yuu-chan's back! Mom's so happy!"

Martina eagerly sat on the bed edge, leaning close. This flustered Yuu instead. Since his divorce, only hostesses and paid encounters brought women this near - let alone a foreign beauty. Ignoring his turmoil, she hugged him gently - not the desperate cling from when he awoke. Floral sweetness from her brunette hair and citrus from her neck tickled his nose, while soft, elastic breasts pressed against him. *(Whoa... th-this is...)*

The middle-aged Yuu felt aroused amid embarrassment. The urge to push away and conflicting nostalgia came from the original Yuu. Yuu lightly hugged Martina's back - appropriate for one's mother. After a minute, Martina reluctantly pulled away, clearly wanting more. They gazed at each other breathlessly.

"Mom's heading home now."

"Thanks for visiting."

"...! Yuu-chan!"

She hugged him tightly and kissed his cheek.

"Ah! That... um..."

Flustered by her action, Martina pulled back. Yuu smiled, hiding his pounding heart.

"Be careful going home, Mom."

"Hah! Yes! I'll come back! Definitely! See you tomorrow!"

Waving energetically, she left with repeated glances. Yuu smiled wryly - this felt more like lovers than mother and son.

### Author's Afterword

This isn't "reborn" in the reincarnation sense but time-leaping/possession via parallel worlds. However, to avoid title overlap with other works and for better phrasing, I chose "reborn." From the protagonist's view, restarting life as a 15-year-old in another world fits.

Also, using the typo report function, "……" was noted. I use "…" or "……" to indicate pauses. Opinions on whether this is acceptable are welcome.
